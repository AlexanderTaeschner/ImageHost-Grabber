- Add a check for low space, no space, and read-only on target source.
	This should be simple to add.  Must research nsIFile (and associted interfaces).  For low space and read-only, needs to alert the user of problem, then ask the user to change destination, abort, or save session to cache file.  The qualification for low space should be anything less than 100MB (or maybe an optional value in settings?).  If the low space condition is met, then the user should be alerted and give the option to continue, abort, change destination, or save session to cache file.
	
- Add confirmation to close download window if not empty
	This should prevent accidental closing of the download window. If the download window is empty, then there should be no confirmation. Otherwise, the user should be warned that he/she is about to close the window with active/inactive downloads (or other items left in the download list). The user should then be able to save the session and close (must first check to see if "Save session on exit" is checked), close without saving, or abort the close window process. A window option should be added (under "Window Options") added to allow people to not be bothered by it if they don't want the confirmation.
	
- Add a windows script (or batch file) to make download IHG from github and package it.
	This will require an open-source zip and wget program.  This should not a problem to find (MinGW compiled versions of linux versions).  Also, we should see if github allows any options in this department.
	
Enhancements:
- Better host file merging
	Present the user with a diff of the changes and let user deny or accept specific changes.  Can github tools me helpful in this way?
